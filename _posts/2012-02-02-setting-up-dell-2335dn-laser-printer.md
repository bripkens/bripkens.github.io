At work, there is a Dell 2335dn laser printer for which there don't seem to be
any Linux drivers. Luckily though, I could get it to work using HP LaserJet 3
drivers. So whenever you don't find an appropriate driver for your printer,
give the aforementioned one a try. Maybe your are luckily and can save yourself
some time :-).
