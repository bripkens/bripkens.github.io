<a title="Project home page" href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is great as it adds some neat functionality to your stylesheets, e.g. nesting, mixins, variables and math. Since it is a command line tool you can execute it like

{% highlight bash %}
sass --watch input.scss:output.css
{% endhighlight %}

Having to type this command is tedious and creating a .sh or .bat script for this requires you to maintain two files. Â My approach is to create a custom django-admin command <em>watchsass</em> for this. How this is generally done can be read on <a title="Django documentation on custom django-admin commands" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-management-commands/">this page</a>. The following listing shows the command which I'm using in a small project right now.


{% highlight python %}

        print "Sass watch parameter is not used due to some bug."

        last_update = os.stat(scss).st_mtime
        os.system(command)

        while True:
            if not last_update == os.stat(scss).st_mtime:
                os.system(command)
                last_update = os.stat(scss).st_mtime
                print "Updated stylesheet at %s" % datetime.datetime.now()

{% endhighlight %}


As you can see I'm not using the --watch flag. This is because it's not working on my system.
